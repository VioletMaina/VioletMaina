            <p><image src="./travel.jpg" />I travel to scratch that itch to go out and get lost. I travel to take a break from the routine. I travel to see new places and meet new people and cultures. But I also travel for the way that travel changes me. I travel to find my limits, physical and mental and then I try to push them a little bit. Sometimes this goes well, sometimes it doesnâ€™t but when I leave my comfort zone is when I truly feel alive and free.</p>
